# Zuccaro_Lab_scripts

Collection of scripts and notebooks from work within the Zuccaro lab (UoC)

PAM_analysis_pipeline is a set of scripts for automation of 24-well plate images and extraction of plant photosynthetic area and photosynthetic efficiency (FvFm) data. These scripts, specifically for obtaining FvFm values of plants, was based on scripts previously published by Schneider et al., 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13007-019-0546-1) and released by the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (https://plantcv.danforthcenter.org/). Thanks also to Walz GmbH for providing the pim2tiff executable for conversion of .pim image files.
